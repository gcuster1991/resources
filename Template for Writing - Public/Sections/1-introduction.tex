\section*{Introduction}

This is the introduction text. And an example of how you might cite \cite{Patterson2012}. You could also just add a citation at the end of the sentence \citep{Patterson2012} or refer to a specific paper (e.g. \citealt{Patterson2012}). All of these citations are hyperlinked, so you can click on them to go to the references section.
